\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank all my friends who have supported me, both by helping me to disconnect and by motivating me during the most difficult moments of my research. But I would particularly like to highlight the help of Nicole, who has encouraged me to keep going at all times, cheered me up when I needed it and spent many hours reviewing what caused me the most uncertainty: writing in English. Without your help, I probably wouldn't have finished on time.

I would also like to express my gratitude to my two tutors, Miguel Cárdenas and Miguel Ángel Gutiérrez, for their patience throughout the development of this work. I sincerely appreciate their willingness to correct my mistakes, as well as their efforts to find time to meet with me and guide me, even in difficult moments.
